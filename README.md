## short hash

How fast can you hash a 64-bit or 32-bit machine word?

### Requirements

- x86-64 processor supporting the SSSE3 and CLMUL instruction sets
  (most since 2011)

- Linux like system

## Usage

```bash
make
./benchmark.exe
```

## Todo 
- clang appears remarkably faster (``export CC=clang``)
- Test with hash table
